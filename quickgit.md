git branch -d old-branch-name # Delete ur old local branch (optional)

```


#### IMPORTANT RULES
- NEVER push directly to main
- ALWAYS pull before starting new work  
- Create NEW branch for each feature
- Get at least 1 approval before merging PR
- Write CLEAR commit messages

#### If you see CONFLICT when pulling
Open the conflicted files
Look for <<<<<<< and >>>>>>> markers  
Keep the code you want, delete the markers
Then: git add . → git commit -m "Resolve conflict" → git push
